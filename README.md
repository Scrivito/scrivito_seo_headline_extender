# ScrivitoSeoHeadlineExtender

A Scrivito widget for adding a headline that lets you control its size and style for better SEO.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'scrivito_seo_headline_extender'

Add this line to your application Stylesheet manifest:

    *= require scrivito_seo_headline_extender

If your app already includes a Headline widget, you need to delete it to avoid a conflict.

## Customization

We recommend to use [Scrivito Advanced Editors](https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_advanced_editors) which provides nicer controls.
